[Miniature snap-action switch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_snap-action_switch)
----
A miniature snap-action switch, also trademarked and frequently known as
a micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little
physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes
called an "over-center" mechanism. .

The defining feature of micro switches is that a relatively small
movement at the actuator button produces a relatively large movement at
the electrical contacts, which occurs at high speed (regardless of the
speed of actuation). Most successful designs also exhibit hysteresis,
meaning that a small reversal of the actuator is insufficient to reverse
the contacts; there must be a significant movement in the opposite
direction. Both of these characteristics help to achieve a clean and
reliable interruption to the switched circuit. 

Microswitches have two main areas of application:

    Firstly they are used when a low operating force with a clearly defined action is needed.
    Secondly they are used when long-term reliability is needed. This is a result of the internal mechanism and the independence of the closing force on the switch contacts from the operating force. Switch reliability is largely a question of the contact force: a force which is reliably adequate, but never excessive, encourages long life.

Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a
microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending
machines, arcade buttons, and to detect paper jams or other faults in
photocopiers. Micro switches are commonly used in tamper switches on
gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems,
where it is necessary to know if a valve has been opened or shut. .

...I was left with reed switch and micro switch. My initial
experimentation with reed switches proved they would be a bit
problematic to mount and to align right....

[Miniature snap-action switch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_snap-action_switch)

At its heart is a single board, a Talk2 Whisper Node. This packs a
low-power version of the ATmega328 microcontroller alongside a LoRa
radio and an efficient power regulator allowing it to draw only 8.70 uA
in standby mode, waking up only for extremely short periods to check for
mail and report via LoRa to The Things Network. The sensor is simply a
microswitch, selected after finding a reed switch problematic to
install. Finally an SDR was used to debug the operation of the radio.\\

“My next goal is to upgrade to a 48v electric system with more solar
panels and of course a bigger outboard engine to achieve an epic trip of
more than 1,000 km on the Danube river in Romania using only solar power
and to prove that this technology is sustainable and will have a bigger

[3DPCBoy – build your own handheld gaming platform – Johan von Konow](https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/2020/01/3dpcboy-build-your-own-handheld-gaming-platform/)
3DPCBoy is using a rather unique approach – is not built around a glass
fiber PCB like most electronics. Instead it uses a 3D Printed Circuit
Board (3DPCB). This makes it easier to replicate, less expensive and you
don’t need to wait for a PCB delivery. If you want to know more about
3DPCB, or use it in your own project, you can read about the development
here .
