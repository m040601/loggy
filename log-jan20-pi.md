[Miniature snap-action switch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_snap-action_switch)
----
A miniature snap-action switch, also trademarked and frequently known as
a micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little
physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes
called an "over-center" mechanism. .

The defining feature of micro switches is that a relatively small
movement at the actuator button produces a relatively large movement at
the electrical contacts, which occurs at high speed (regardless of the
speed of actuation). Most successful designs also exhibit hysteresis,
meaning that a small reversal of the actuator is insufficient to reverse
the contacts; there must be a significant movement in the opposite
direction. Both of these characteristics help to achieve a clean and
reliable interruption to the switched circuit. 

Microswitches have two main areas of application:

    Firstly they are used when a low operating force with a clearly defined action is needed.
    Secondly they are used when long-term reliability is needed. This is a result of the internal mechanism and the independence of the closing force on the switch contacts from the operating force. Switch reliability is largely a question of the contact force: a force which is reliably adequate, but never excessive, encourages long life.

Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a
microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending
machines, arcade buttons, and to detect paper jams or other faults in
photocopiers. Micro switches are commonly used in tamper switches on
gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems,
where it is necessary to know if a valve has been opened or shut. .

[Miniature snap-action switch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_snap-action_switch)

At its heart is a single board, a Talk2 Whisper Node. This packs a
low-power version of the ATmega328 microcontroller alongside a LoRa
radio and an efficient power regulator allowing it to draw only 8.70 uA
in standby mode, waking up only for extremely short periods to check for
mail and report via LoRa to The Things Network. The sensor is simply a
microswitch, selected after finding a reed switch problematic to
install. Finally an SDR was used to debug the operation of the radio.\\

RS-485, also known as TIA-485(-A) or EIA-485, is a standard defining the
electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial
communications systems. Electrical signaling is balanced, and multipoint
systems are supported. The standard is jointly published by the
Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries
Alliance (TIA/EIA). Digital communications networks implementing the
standard can be used effectively over long distances and in electrically
noisy environments. Multiple receivers may be connected to such a
network in a linear, multidrop bus. These characteristics make RS-485
useful in industrial control systems and similar applications. .

M12 waterproof connectors
------
...The M12 connector, specified in IEC 61076-2-101, is a circular
electrical plug/receptacle pair with 12mm OD mating threads, used in
NMEA 2000, DeviceNet, IO-Link, some kinds of Industrial Ethernet,
etc.[16][17]

A disadvantage of the circular design is its inefficient use of panel
space when used in arrays, when compared to rectangular connectors.

Circular connectors commonly use backshells, which provide physical and
electromagnetic protection, whilst sometimes also providing a method for
locking the connector into a receptacle.[18] In some cases, this
backshell provides a hermetic seal, or some degree of ingress
protection, through the use of grommets, O-rings, or potting.[15]

A few serial UARTs add negligible cost to a mass-produced PC chipset IC,

to run a DB-9 connector out to the board edge. There is also a cost in
PCB space; space at the board edge is especially precious..
