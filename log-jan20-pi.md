[Miniature snap-action switch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_snap-action_switch)
----
A miniature snap-action switch, also trademarked and frequently known as
a micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little
physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes
called an "over-center" mechanism. .

The defining feature of micro switches is that a relatively small
movement at the actuator button produces a relatively large movement at
the electrical contacts, which occurs at high speed (regardless of the
speed of actuation). Most successful designs also exhibit hysteresis,
meaning that a small reversal of the actuator is insufficient to reverse
the contacts; there must be a significant movement in the opposite
direction. Both of these characteristics help to achieve a clean and
reliable interruption to the switched circuit. 

Microswitches have two main areas of application:

    Firstly they are used when a low operating force with a clearly defined action is needed.
    Secondly they are used when long-term reliability is needed. This is a result of the internal mechanism and the independence of the closing force on the switch contacts from the operating force. Switch reliability is largely a question of the contact force: a force which is reliably adequate, but never excessive, encourages long life.

Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a
microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending
machines, arcade buttons, and to detect paper jams or other faults in
photocopiers. Micro switches are commonly used in tamper switches on
gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems,
where it is necessary to know if a valve has been opened or shut. .

[Miniature snap-action switch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_snap-action_switch)

At its heart is a single board, a Talk2 Whisper Node. This packs a
low-power version of the ATmega328 microcontroller alongside a LoRa
radio and an efficient power regulator allowing it to draw only 8.70 uA
in standby mode, waking up only for extremely short periods to check for
mail and report via LoRa to The Things Network. The sensor is simply a
microswitch, selected after finding a reed switch problematic to
install. Finally an SDR was used to debug the operation of the radio.\\

meshstatic critic and others
----

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22540066

 The idea of these radio mesh network things is great. The reality is
 terrible because radio waves need line of sight unless you've got a
 repeater. This is completely impractical when hiking, or in a city
 filled with buildings. They end up with crazy short range between
 devices and you need an implausibly long string of them to get from a
 person off the grid to a mesh point on the grid. The only exception to
 this being someone high on a hill with no bumpy bits of other hills
 between them and whoever has the other mesh point that happens to be
 on-grid..

Gotenna couldn't make this work with all their $$ because of the simple physics of radio waves. Yes they sell devices that technically do what they claim, they just fall flat on their faces when they encounter hills, or buildings... or anything that isn't flat.

 Use the most appropriate of the many ham radio digital packet systems for whatever wavelength you're broadcasting on and choose the appropriate part of the spectrum that is designated for digital packet use.

Also be a good radio citizen and try other frequencies if the current one is in use.

I understand that the ham license is pretty much a deal breaker for adoption BUT it's what's required to use the decent frequencies and access to repeaters. As this seems to be an open source kind of project and not a "hey lets sell bajillions" kinda thing, that seems like a plausible option.

### difference to disaster radio

We're working with those guys and might share the same protocol stack. Discussions underway.

The difference is: disaster.radio is targeted as a "just in case emergency radio build on custom hardware, that joins a mesh with other folks who bought the same emergency radio."

This is a $30 radio (with built in GPS+radio+CPU+battery+OLED screen) already available from a chinese mfg. Then you put our app on it and have a group navigator you can use with your friends while skiing or hiking, instead of buying a $100 closed source kickstarter (and it will run eight days on a charge)"

RS-485, also known as TIA-485(-A) or EIA-485, is a standard defining the
electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial
communications systems. Electrical signaling is balanced, and multipoint
systems are supported. The standard is jointly published by the
Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries
Alliance (TIA/EIA). Digital communications networks implementing the
standard can be used effectively over long distances and in electrically
noisy environments. Multiple receivers may be connected to such a
network in a linear, multidrop bus. These characteristics make RS-485
useful in industrial control systems and similar applications. .

M12 waterproof connectors
------
...The M12 connector, specified in IEC 61076-2-101, is a circular
electrical plug/receptacle pair with 12mm OD mating threads, used in
NMEA 2000, DeviceNet, IO-Link, some kinds of Industrial Ethernet,
etc.[16][17]

A disadvantage of the circular design is its inefficient use of panel
space when used in arrays, when compared to rectangular connectors.

Circular connectors commonly use backshells, which provide physical and
electromagnetic protection, whilst sometimes also providing a method for
locking the connector into a receptacle.[18] In some cases, this
backshell provides a hermetic seal, or some degree of ingress
protection, through the use of grommets, O-rings, or potting.[15]

### there's no port , but there's a connector
[udev - Why do some Linux distributions still have /dev/ttyS0, ttyS1, etc., even though newer computers don't have such a serial port? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/123518/why-do-some-linux-distributions-still-have-dev-ttys0-ttys1-etc-even-though)

> On some motherboards, there is a [header connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header) for each serial port, and you have to buy an adapter cable if you want to route that connector to the back of the PC:

Other motherboards using the same chipset might not even expose the header connector, even though the feature is available in silicon, purely to save a bit of PCB space and a few cents for the header connector.

A few serial UARTs add negligible cost to a mass-produced PC chipset IC,
whereas it adds a few dollars to the final retail cost of a motherboard
to run a DB-9 connector out to the board edge. There is also a cost in
PCB space; space at the board edge is especially precious..

> -   Rapid manufacturing, no need to wait for PCB prodction and shipping.
> -   No special equipment or materials needed (just an FDM 3D printer, soldering station and wires.
> -   Integrated wire guides show how connections are routed (beginner friendly).
> -   Allows 3 dimensional circuits, opening up for new ways of integrating electronics, reducing size, part count and complexity.
> -   Low costu


[3DPCBoy – build your own handheld gaming platform – Johan von Konow](https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/2020/01/3dpcboy-build-your-own-handheld-gaming-platform/)
3DPCBoy is using a rather unique approach – is not built around a glass
fiber PCB like most electronics. Instead it uses a 3D Printed Circuit
Board (3DPCB). This makes it easier to replicate, less expensive and you
don’t need to wait for a PCB delivery. If you want to know more about
3DPCB, or use it in your own project, you can read about the development
here .
