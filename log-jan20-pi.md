> -   Rapid manufacturing, no need to wait for PCB prodction and shipping.
> -   No special equipment or materials needed (just an FDM 3D printer, soldering station and wires.
> -   Integrated wire guides show how connections are routed (beginner friendly).
> -   Allows 3 dimensional circuits, opening up for new ways of integrating electronics, reducing size, part count and complexity.
> -   Low costu
