> -   Rapid manufacturing, no need to wait for PCB prodction and shipping.
> -   No special equipment or materials needed (just an FDM 3D printer, soldering station and wires.
> -   Integrated wire guides show how connections are routed (beginner friendly).
> -   Allows 3 dimensional circuits, opening up for new ways of integrating electronics, reducing size, part count and complexity.
> -   Low costu


[3DPCBoy – build your own handheld gaming platform – Johan von Konow](https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/2020/01/3dpcboy-build-your-own-handheld-gaming-platform/)
3DPCBoy is using a rather unique approach – is not built around a glass
fiber PCB like most electronics. Instead it uses a 3D Printed Circuit
Board (3DPCB). This makes it easier to replicate, less expensive and you
don’t need to wait for a PCB delivery. If you want to know more about
3DPCB, or use it in your own project, you can read about the development
here .
