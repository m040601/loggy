Sometimes water damage can be undone by completely soaking in distilled water to rid the impure water and rinse off the salts, and then letting dry.

You can speed this process up by gently scrubbing with Dawn dish soap and lots of regular water, as long as you keep it wet. The key is to thoroughly rinse everything with distilled water before anything starts drying off.
