put the following in ~/bin after replacing eDP1 with the screen your touchpad
to follow. can get a list of your screens by running xrandr.

change --output eDP1 to -o if you want to rotate all screens.

you may need to play around with the code that gets the xinput id for your
touchpad.

make sure it is executable and also bin is in $PATH variable.

without stuff that doesn't pretain your question

	#!/bin/bash

	if [ $status == 'primary' ]; then
	   state="$(xrandr -q|grep eDP1|awk '{print $5}')"
	else
	   state="$(xrandr -q|grep eDP1|awk '{print $4}')"
	fi
	touchpad=$(xinput | awk '/Touchpad/ {print $7}' | grep -oP [0-9]+) #


	case "${state}" in

	> 
	> Mostrar conte√∫do cortado


Sections are constructed based on heading elements. (h1, h2, etc.
in HTML.)

So, assuming your documents have h2s and not h1s, you'd need to
insert an h1 with the title of the chapter in front of each html
file.

[bash - Start a process on a different tty - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/170063/start-a-process-on-a-different-tty)

> fter about an hour of Googling this, I can't _believe_ nobody has actually asked this question before...
> 
> So I've got a script running on TTY1. How do I make that script launch some arbitrary program on TTY2?
> 
> -   I found `tty`, which tells you which TTY you're currently on.
> -   I found `writevt`, which writes a single line of text onto a different TTY.
> -   I found `chvt`, which changes which TTY is currently displayed.
> 
> I don't want to _display_ TTY2. I just want the main script to continue executing normally, but if I manually switch to TTY2 I can interact with the second program.
> 
> [bash](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bash "show questions tagged 'bash'") [tty](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tty "show questions tagged 'tty'")

                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            


setsid sh -c 'exec command <> /dev/tty2 >&0 2>&1'

As long as nothing else is using the other TTY (/dev/tty2 in this example), this should work. This includes a getty process that may be waiting for someone to login; having more than one process reading its input from a TTY will lead to unexpected results.

setsid takes care of starting the command in a new session.

Note that command will have to take care of setting the stty settings correctly, e.g. turn on "cooked mode" and onlcr so that outputting a newline will add a carriage return, etc.




### tty vs console vs dev

[Linux: Difference between /dev/console , /dev/tty and /dev/tty0 - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60641/linux-difference-between-dev-console-dev-tty-and-dev-tty0)

> 96
> 
> From the [documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt):
> 
>     /dev/tty        Current TTY device
>     /dev/console    System console
>     /dev/tty0       Current virtual console
>     
> 
> In the good old days `/dev/console` was System Administrator console. And TTYs were users' serial devices attached to a server. Now `/dev/console` and `/dev/tty0` represent current display and usually are the same. You can override it for example by adding `console=ttyS0` to `grub.conf`. After that your `/dev/tty0` is a monitor and `/dev/console` is `/dev/ttyS0`.
> 
> An exercise to show the difference between `/dev/tty` and `/dev/tty0`:
> 
> Switch to the 2nd console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2. Login as `root`. Type `sleep 5; echo tty0 > /dev/tty0`. Press Enter and switch to the 3rd console by pressing Alt+F3. Now switch back to the 2nd console by pressing Alt+F2. Type `sleep 5; echo tty > /dev/tty`, press Enter and switch to the 3rd console.
> 
> You can see that `tty` is the console where process starts, and `tty0` is a always current console.

metabest metadata in ranger

:meta stores the metadata in the ".metadata.json" file for each directory in which it is used.


[Official User Guide ¬∑ ranger/ranger Wiki](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Official-user-guide)

> ## Metadata
> 
> Storing the file metadata is a brand new feature of `ranger`. It may be used to add arbitrary key-value data to any file. Calling `:meta title a very interesting title` will set the tag "title" of the current file to "a very interesting title".
> 
> `:meta` is most commonly used in conjunction with `:linemode`. The built-in linemodes are bound to "M" followed by some letter. At the moment of writing this guide, there are 6 built-in linemodes:
> 
> -   `filename`: no metadata, the default mode of ranger,
> -   `permissions`: file permissions are displayed next to the files,
> -   `fileinfo`: show file type information based on shell `file` commmand
> -   `mtime`: show the modified time of files
> -   `sizemtime`: show the size and the modified time
> -   `metatitle`: see below.
> 
> The last line mode, `metatitle`, is extremely handy for organizing all sorts of documents: books, movies, pictures and more. It displays the files based on their metadata. The current format is: `[[year - ]title] alignment [authors]`. Bracketed content is ignored if empty. The `title` field is mandatory for this to work. To define a custom linemode, please refer to this page: [Custom linemodes](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Custom-linemodes).

metabest rsync separate by video resolution but mantain tree struct
----

https://old.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/f2c7hk/how_to_move_files_while_preserving_subdirectory/


   I have a large amount of videos in subdirectories. I wish to separate 720p
   and 1080p videos to a new directory preserving the subdirectories
   structure.

   videos1/AAA/abc1080p.mp4

   videos1/BBB/fgh720p.mp4

   videos1/CCC/xyz1080p.mp4

   .....

   videos2/720p/BBB/fgh720p.mp4

   videos2/1080p/AAA/abc1080p.mp4

   videos2/1080p/CCC/xyz1080p.mp4


### A1   Something like this with rsync:

 $ mkdir -p a/b
 $ touch a/b/move a/b/dontmove
 $ rsync -rv --include='*/' --include='b/move' --exclude='*' --prune-empty-dirs a/ new_a/

   So now new_a contains b/move, but not b/dontmove, and it kept the relative
   paths within the two.

   The first include tells rsync to copy all directories, the second gives
   the name of a file to copy (can also be glob pattern) and the exclude
   tells it not to move anything else. You could add --remove-source-files to
   make it a move instead of a copy, but be careful with that.

### A2 for hard links
 $ cd /path/to/videos1/..
 $ mkdir videos2
 $ cd videos1
 $ for res in 720 1080 ; do mkdir ../videos2/${res}p ; rsync -av -f'+ */' -f'- *' ./ ../videos2/${res}p/ ; find . -type f -name "*${res}p*.mp4" | xargs -L1 -I@ ln @ ../videos2/${res}p/@ ; done

   This creates hard-links so they don't take any more space than the
   originals (well, beyond another inode). If you really do want to move
   them, you can change the ln to mv

   Not even another inode, just a few bytes in the target directory file.

   To break that down, the rsync command mirrors the directory hierarchy
   while the find locates all the files in videos1/ of the given resolution
   and links (ln) or moves (mv) them into the corresponding location in
   videos2/

### A3   I'm thinking about using cp with --parent option to preserve directory:

   ls videos1/*/*1080p* | xargs cp --parent -t videos2/1080p/

   Assuming you're in a parent directory containing videos{1,2}, by issuing
   ls videos1/*/*1080p* you'll find all files in videos1 dir with 1080p in
   its name. You'll pipe the output into xargs, which feed it into cp
   command. In cp, you'll need to specify the target folder using -t option
   and you can preserve directory structure using --parent.

   Source:
   [175]https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/83593/copy-specific-file-type-keeping-the-folder-structure/314823#314823

   Another trick using find -exec:

### A4   Lots of good answers here, but I figure I'll throw something else here
   based on how I would do that.

 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 find "${_path_to_videos}" -mindepth 1 -type f -name "*.mp4" | while read -r _file; do
     _qual="720p"
     if [[ "${_file,,}" =~ 1080p\.mp4 ]]; then _qual="1080p"; fi
     _dir="${_file#*\/}"
     _dir="${_dir%\/*}"
     mkdir --parents "${_path_to_videos}/${_qual}/${_file*\/}"
     mv "${_file}" "${_path_to_videos}/1080p/${_file#*\/}"
 done

   This assumes the paths are relative, not absolute. Also, this doesn't have
   to be in a script -- but its certainly easier to write it out/modify than
   writing it on the terminal.

   Somewhat unrelated, but what do those underscores achieve here apart from
   decreasing readability?


   I guess it's there so you won't override the default value. For example
   using _dir as to not override dir command. Personally I'd use capital
   letters, but hitting caps-lock or holding shift can be a bother sometimes.

   I kinda get this, but isn't this a bit too far? I mean, ok, you prevent
   overriding some excutable names, but they generally don't collide since
   the shell doesn't susbstitute vars outside of variable expansion context.

 file="foobar"
 file /bin/ls
 echo $file
 baz=$(file /bin/ls)
 echo $baz

   All work as expected. And you also can call it input_file and out_dir or
   something. All those underscores make me dizzy :) Just sharing the view.

   Well, I didn't know that--so, that's nice to know.

   As for why the underscores -- while I generally use Camel-Case, I tend to
   use underscores for separation in both shell & batch scripts. Especially
   in batch since the entire interpreter is case-insensitive; so the standard
   straight up doesn't work if I needed to have similarly named variables
   (for some reason).

   I find it easier to read with what I'm working on with syntax
   highlighting...that and the underscores keep things visually seperated in
   a logical way--at least to me. Looking at it now, without any coloration
   change or otherwise...it is a little bit much.

fuck cp --parents - fish for csv's and mantain structure

I have a folder structure with a bunch of *.csv files scattered across the folders. Now I want to copy all *.csv files to another destination keeping the folder structure.

It works by doing:

	cp --parents *.csv /target
	cp --parents */*.csv" /target
	cp --parents */*/*.csv /target
	cp --parents */*/*/*.csv /target
	...

and so on, but I would like to do it using one command.

"Why I get message 'Omitting directory' ?" It's because at each level that it's copying, there are subdirs; and cp is telling you that these subdirs are not being copied. You adapted the command to your needs, and whatever you have in -name includes subdirs, which in the "csv" example, it didn't. You would need -r to recursively copy the subdirs; but you don't want that, because copying the subdirs is being covered by the find itself. Depending on what you're doing, obviously. Maybe you want. But most probably not. :$ ‚Äì msb Mar 5 '18 at 18:52

Both of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a '\') or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell." ‚Äì Paul Rougieux Sep 14 '18 at 11:37

>Hybrid Requests

One interesting use case of the request system is the utilization of hybrid requests. In curl, different requests can be combined on the same command line as follows:
curl -d user=daniel https://example.com https://another.example.com
1
	
curl -d user=daniel https://example.com https://another.example.com

Of note is the fact that there‚Äôs no real limit to the number of URLs that can be used in such a scheme, meaning you could theoretically do a great number of requests to a great number of API endpoints on a single CLI line. This is especially useful when multiple requests have to be made to coalesce content ‚Äì in fact, in this use case, you could use the same hybrid approach noted here, and then pipe these contents to a filename for combinatory efforts.

You can also set the specific order of this process by using --next as follows:
curl -d user=daniel https://example.com --next https://another.example.com
1
	
curl -d user=daniel https://example.com --next https://another.example.com

Conversely, if you wanted to do different things on the same line, you can do that too!
curl https://example.com --next -d user=daniel https://another.example.com
1
	
curl https://example.com --next -d user=daniel https://another.example.com 
> curl  -d  user=daniel https://example.com --next https://another.example.com
> 
> Conversely, if you wanted to do different things on the same line, you can do that too!

> curl https://example.com --next -d user=daniel https://another.example.com

   + 4.3 Pipe the escapes to any tty (with write/append perms) to modify that
    terminal


DPMS interaction in a Linux console with setterm

The setterm utility issues terminal recognized escape codes to alter the
terminal. Essentially it just writes/echos the terminal sequences to the
current terminal device, whether that be in screen, a remote ssh terminal,
console mode, serial consoles, etc.

setterm Syntax: (0 disables)

setterm -blank [0-60|force|poke]
setterm -powersave [on|vsync|hsync|powerdown|off]
setterm -powerdown [0-60]


Prevent screen from turning off
	$ setterm -blank 0 -powerdown 0
Alternatively 
	# echo -ne "\033[9;0]" >> /etc/issue
Changing 0 (after the semicolon) to e.g. 3, will keep the screen on for
minutes, before entering standby mode.

Pipe the output to a cat to see the escapes
	$ setterm -powerdown 2>&1 | exec cat -v 2>&1 | sed "s/\\^\\[/\\\\033/g"

Pipe the escapes to any tty (with write/append perms) to modify that terminal
	$ setterm -powerdown 0 >> /dev/tty3

### wdiff and dwdiff


dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level instead
of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows
the user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in
that it takes an optional list of characters that should be
considered delimiters. Delimiters are single characters that are
treated as if they are words, even when there is no whitespace
separating them from preceding words or delimiters. dwdiff is
mostly command-line compatible with wdiff. Only the --autopager,
--terminal and --avoid-wraps options are not supported.

Q: Why not SuperMemo or other better algorithms?

    Hotkey daemons like sxhkd can be used to bind mpvc commands to key combinations. Alternatively check your window manager documentation on how to bind keys to commands.
    Any URL that can be played using mpv can be added to the playlist, e.g. using mps-youtube with player set to mpvc and playerargs set to add.
    mpvc GNU options can be combined together to give improved results: $ mpvc -P -j 1 will make mpvc always start playing when switching to the next track.
    Piping files directly into mpvc is possible and preferable when loading multiple directories to be played:

#### wpa_cli MUSTDO (get net list etc)
Optionally, also install the official wpa_supplicant_guiAUR which provides wpa_gui, a graphical front-end for wpa_supplicant, or wpa-cuteAUR which is a fork from an earlier version of wpa_gui with a couple of fixes and improvements. .


At boot (systemd)

The wpa_supplicant package provides multiple systemd service files:

    wpa_supplicant.service - uses D-Bus, recommended for NetworkManager users.
    wpa_supplicant@interface.service - accepts the interface name as an argument and starts the wpa_supplicant daemon for this interface. It reads a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-interface.conf configuration file.
    wpa_supplicant-nl80211@interface.service - also interface specific, but explicitly forces the nl80211 driver (see below). The configuration file path is /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-nl80211-interface.conf.
    wpa_supplicant-wired@interface.service - also interface specific, uses the wired driver. The configuration file path is /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wired-interface.conf.

To enable wireless at boot, enable an instance of one of the above services on a particular wireless interface. For example, enable the wpa_supplicant@interface systemd unit.

Now choose and enable an instance of a service to obtain an ip address for the particular interface as indicated in the #Overview. For example, enable the dhcpcd@interface systemd unit.




##### METABEST wpa_cli action script

wpa_cli can run in daemon mode and execute a specified script based on events from wpa_supplicant. Two events are supported: CONNECTED and DISCONNECTED. Some environment variables are available to the script, see wpa_cli(8) for details.

The following example will use desktop notifications to notify the user about the events:

	#!/bin/bash

	case "$2" in
	    CONNECTED)
		notify-send "WPA supplicant: connection established";
		;;
	    DISCONNECTED)
		notify-send "WPA supplicant: connection lost";
		;;
	esac

Remember to make the script executable, then use the -a flag to pass the script path to wpa_cli:



#### you fucknig dont need dhcpcd neither the tool nor the service - sysd-netd has an "internal" one
#### if netctl then dhcpcd ( then openresolv ???)
also some gui's (gigantic deps)


	# netctl enable profile
	This will create and enable a systemd service that will start when the computer boots. Changes to the profile file will not propagate to the service file automatically. After such changes, it is necessary to reenable the profile:
	# netctl reenable profile

###  command grouping

[Command Grouping (Bash Reference Manual)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Grouping.html)

	> #### 3.2.4.3 Grouping Commands
	> 
	> Bash provides two ways to group a list of commands to be executed as a unit. When commands are grouped, redirections may be applied to the entire command list. For example, the output of all the commands in the list may be redirected to a single stream.
	> 
	> `()`
	> 
	> ( list )
	> 
	> Placing a list of commands between parentheses causes a subshell environment to be created (see [Command Execution Environment](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Execution-Environment.html#Command-Execution-Environment)), and each of the commands in list to be executed in that subshell. Since the list is executed in a subshell, variable assignments do not remain in effect after the subshell completes.
	> 
	> `{}`
	> 
	> { list; }
	> 
	> Placing a list of commands between curly braces causes the list to be executed in the current shell context. No subshell is created. The semicolon (or newline) following list is required.
	> 
	> In addition to the creation of a subshell, there is a subtle difference between these two constructs due to historical reasons. The braces are `reserved words`, so they must be separated from the list by `blank`s or other shell metacharacters. The parentheses are `operators`, and are recognized as separate tokens by the shell even if they are not separated from the list by whitespace.
	> 
	> The exit status of both of these constructs is the exit status of list.

   + 4.3 Pipe the escapes to any tty (with write/append perms) to modify that

DPMS interaction in a Linux console with setterm

The setterm utility issues terminal recognized escape codes to alter the
terminal. Essentially it just writes/echos the terminal sequences to the
current terminal device, whether that be in screen, a remote ssh terminal,
console mode, serial consoles, etc.

setterm Syntax: (0 disables)

setterm -blank [0-60|force|poke]
setterm -powersave [on|vsync|hsync|powerdown|off]
setterm -powerdown [0-60]


Prevent screen from turning off
	$ setterm -blank 0 -powerdown 0
Alternatively 
	# echo -ne "\033[9;0]" >> /etc/issue
Changing 0 (after the semicolon) to e.g. 3, will keep the screen on for
minutes, before entering standby mode.

Pipe the output to a cat to see the escapes
	$ setterm -powerdown 2>&1 | exec cat -v 2>&1 | sed "s/\\^\\[/\\\\033/g"

Pipe the escapes to any tty (with write/append perms) to modify that terminal
	$ setterm -powerdown 0 >> /dev/tty3

Notably, the site is entirely powered by Datasette. It‚Äôs a heavily customized

It‚Äôs a really fun experiment. I‚Äôm essentially using Datasette as a weird twist

there‚Äôs still stuff

Continuous deployment

The site is entirely stateless and is published using Circle CI to a serverless hosting provider (currently Zeit Now v1, but I‚Äôll probably move it to Google Cloud Run in the near future.)

The site content‚Äî46 museums and counting‚Äîlives in the museums.yaml file. I‚Äôve been adding a new museum listing every day by editing the YAML file using Working Copy on my iPhone.

The build script runs automatically on every commit. It converts the YAML file into a SQLite database using my yaml-to-sqlite tool, then runs datasette publish now... to deploy the resulting database.

I've been experimenting recently with YAML for this kind of thing, and it's working out really well for me so far.

I have a tool called yaml-to-sqlite ( https://github.com/simonw/yaml-to-sqlite ) which converts a YAML file into a SQLite database, which I can then use with Datasette ( https://github.com/simonw/datasette )

My biggest project with it so far has been my site https://www.niche-museums.com/ - a guide to small and niche museums. The museums themselves live in a single ~100KB YAML file in GitHub: https://github.com/simonw/museums/blob/master/museums.yaml

I have a CI script which builds that YAML file into a SQLite database and deploys it + Datasette + custom templates to https://www.niche-museums.com/

I've been running the site like this for a few months now and I really like it. I love having my content in source control, I find editing the YAML to be reasonably pleasant (I even edit it on my iPhone sometimes using the W

How might we grow an open source ecosystem of tools to help data journalists
collect, analyze and publish the data underlying their stories?

I‚Äôve worked with newspapers a few times in the past: I helped create what would
later become Django at the Lawrence Journal-World fifteen years ago, and I
spent two years working on data journalism projects at the Guardian in London
before being sucked into the tech startup world. My Datasette project was
inspired by the challenges I saw at the Guardian, and I‚Äôm hoping to evolve it
(and its accompanying ecosystem) in as useful a way as possible.

[unix - Piping to notify-send in chunks - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34778384/piping-to-notify-send-in-chunks)


This puts the complete output of mocha -w in the fourth argument of notify-send

If mocha -w does not terminate, the bash-specific read -t comes in handy:

mocha -w | ( while true; do MSG=""; while read -t .1 LINE; do MSG="$MSG $LINE"; done; if [ "$MSG" != "" ]; then notify-send -t 5000 "$MSG"; fi; done; )

This aggregates all lines which come in in the timeframe of 1/10th second in one message. You can adjust this timeout to fit your needs. Note that this is bash-specific, other shells (i.e. dash) may not support it.

TLDR 
However, even with all the WebP‚Äôs technical prowess, JPEG and PNG are
not leaving the ring anywhere soon as it only works in browsers
environments: if you save a WebP image to a disk, you most likely won‚Äôt
be able to open it with default image viewing software on your system..

- convert (magick) enough for most cases
- mozjpge
- webp is the future
- Using GIFs for animations on your webpage in 2019 is an incredibly bad idea.
- You are better off publishing your animated content as video files: either MP4 or WebM.





To summarize, JPEG is fine to be used in:

    Backgrounds;
    large camera photos: avatars, banners, etc.;
    images when super-precise quality is not our goal.

To summarize, PNG is ideal for:

    Images that need to be transparent;
    charts, schemes, highly detailed maps, and details matter;
    images that contain text.


webp
But as you will soon see, the advantages outweigh compatibility
problems. A lossless flavor of WebP outperforms PNG by still keeping
images sharp and transparent while the lossy version of the format wipes
the floor with JPEG and still supports opacity..

Where WebP really shines is the compression at the lowest possible
quality. WebP at quality 0% is still perceived much better by your eyes
than JPEG at quality 10%..

### anim gifs

But enough talk, time to crunch some numbers. We will start with a
cheesy GIF source and convert it to WebP, APNG, AV1 as MP4, H.264 as
MP4, and WebM to detect a winner. We will use CLI tools gif2webp and
gif2apng, as well as ffmpeg. We will also use GIMP as an alternative way
to convert GIF to WebP..

The size of the GIF is reduced by 90% when using video codecs and by 67%
using compressed WebP by GIMP. So if you want to make the web faster
(and better), think about always using MP4 as an animated image instead
of GIF. See, you don‚Äôt have to be a 10x engineer to reduce the size of
the assets by 10x!.
