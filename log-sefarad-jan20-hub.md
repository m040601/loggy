Port Cities of Atlantic Iberia, c. 15001900 by Patrick OFlanagan (z-lib.org).pdf

How can this ascendancy be accounted for? For the most part it was a legacy of Pombal’s rigid 
political economy, which, in 1774, reduced the privileges of, and investments in, ports such as 
Aveiro, Caminha, Esposende, Viana do Castelo and Vila do Conde and barred them from engaging 
in certain maritime trading activities. Oporto benefited enormously from this prohibition and a 
contemporary observer noted that the trades of the ports mentioned above were, almost in their 
entirety, transferred to Oporto (Rebelo da Costa, 1954). 
Both Oporto and Lisbon also held exclusive rights regarding the importation of most colonial


...(Mountinho, 1985). Viana then became the location, in 1654, for Portugal’s third English feitoria, 
an acknowledgement of its prime trading role. Most of its resident merchants were involved in 
the exportation of Grand Banks cod. Many boats returning from overseas called to Viana and/or 
Oporto, where they exchanged slaves for wine that was then sold on at English ports. By the end of 
the seventeenth century, the activities of Viana’s English feitoria were progressively transferred to 
Oporto conceding to it an enhanced pivotal role as Portugal’s premier northern Atlantic port.
During the seventeenth century at Oporto, there was a sustained, if
slow, increase in port ...


....Changes that were more substantial became evident in the period after c.1660, as goods from 
England, France, Holland and Hamburg replaced those items that had been traditionally sourced 
from Atlantic Spain. From England came textiles, cod, metal products and paper and these goods 
were largely dispatched from London, Dartmouth, Weymouth and Plymouth. Imports of all kinds 
came from France and Holland chiefly through the ports of Bayonne (wool), Bordeaux (flax) and 
La Rochelle (brai), as well as cereals from many French Atlantic ports. The Brazil trade was weak 
at the time because of political turmoil. Wood for furniture and boat building came from Hamburg 
or Holland. 
A visitor to the port in 1669 recorded that its activities were
relatively modest and noted that ....

António Galvão was the son of Duarte Galvão, chief diplomat and chronicler to king Afonso V of Portugal.[1] 


António Galvão left two manuscripts. One was the treaty of the discoveries printed after his death, in 1563, in Lisbon by his friend Francisco de Sousa Tavares.[4] Based on numerous written sources and documents, the work presented for the first time a synthesis of all the discoveries made by Portuguese and Spanish until 1550. Richard Hakluyt had it translated and published in English in 1601 as "The discoveries of the world - by Antonio Galvano".


...It is alleged that a good part of it was reproduced verbatim within
Damião de Góis's 1566-67 Chronica del rey D. Manuel, but all trace of
the original Galvão manuscript disappeared after Góis's death.[5]...

Java, Korea, Luzon, Malacca, Pattani, Palembang, Siam, and Sumatra.[13].

Japanese products—silver, swords, fans, lacquerware, folding screens—and
Chinese products—medicinal herbs, minted coins, glazed ceramics,
brocades, textiles—were traded within the kingdom for Southeast Asian
sappanwood, rhino horn, tin, sugar, iron, ambergris, Indian ivory, and
Arabian frankincense. Altogether, 150 voyages between the kingdom and
Southeast Asia on Ryukyuan ships were recorded in the Rekidai Hōan, an
official record of diplomatic documents compiled by the kingdom, as

...Then he asked me if I was aware that Spinosa himself, the great
philosopher of Amsterdam, was born in Hol- land of a father and mother
who were themselves of Portuguese birth? I said I was not. Thereupon he
startled me considerably by demanding to know what my opinion might be
upon Spinosa's system of philosophy. I question whether a harmless
tourist was ever asked so searching a question before by a chance
acquaintance. It has been my fortune to have submitted myself for vivd
voce examination in the " schools" of a certain English University; and,
later in life, to have been subjected to a still more terrible public
examination; but on neither of these occasions do I remember to have
been so taken aback as when called upon for an impromptu opinion upon
the Pantheism of Spinosa by this grave Portuguese gentleman riding by my
side on the remote mountains of Traz-os-Montes. I modestly replied that
I was afraid I had not given the subject so much attention as it
deserved: that the system was, no doubt, an ingenious one, but that I
personally did not much hold with it. "Nor do I," said my interlocutor,
eagerly; "neither do our people. Though Spinosa is, per- haps, the
greatest man our race has produced, we of the house of Israel hold him
in no honour. He was a recusant and an apostate from our religion. ...

(1771), Oude Amstel (1784) and Nieuwe Amstel (1799); it closed in 1810

is sometimes used to denote the products of the period 1784–1810, when
the factory was in Oude Amstel and Nieuwe Amstel, but is also used to
denote all the products of the factory from 1764 to 1810. The original
workmen were from Dresden, and the early pottery resembles white Dresden
pottery with landscape and figure decorations; the late pottery tends to
follow French models, especially Sèvres. Amstel tableware and
utilitarian containers suited bourgeois tastes, and apart from a few
busts in biscuit there was no attempt to mimic the refined technical
mastery of Delft pottery. Decoration and shape were eclectic, so the
pottery never developed a strong visual identity. Some pottery is
entirely white, with ornament in low relief; piercings are sometimes
outlined in blue; cartouches contained a wide variety of pictures, often
portraying flowers or landscapes; Sèvres cornflowers are a common
adornment....

nazism and protestantism

On 13 November 1933 a rally of German Christians was held at the Berlin Sportpalast, where — before a packed hall — banners proclaimed the unity of National Socialism and Christianity, interspersed with the omnipresent swastikas. A series of speakers[34] addressed the crowd's pro-Nazi sentiments with ideas such as:

    the removal of all pastors unsympathetic with National Socialism
    the expulsion of members of Jewish descent, who might be arrogated to a separate church
    the implementation of the Aryan Paragraph church-wide
    the removal of the Old Testament from the Bible
    the removal of "non-German" elements from religious services
    the adoption of a more "heroic" and "positive" interpretation of Jesus, who in pro-Aryan fashion should be portrayed to be battling mightily against corrupt Jewish influences.[35]


...

After the Barmen Declaration, there were in effect two opposing movements in the German Protestant Church:

    the German Christian movement and
    the Confessing Church (the Bekennende Kirche, BK), often naming itself Deutsche Evangelische Kirche too, in order to reinforce its claim to be the true church[37]

It should nevertheless be emphasized that the Confessing Church's rebellion was directed at the regim

Aftermath
Some of the leaders of the Confessing Church, such as Martin Niemöller or Heinrich Grüber, were sent to Nazi concentration camps. While Grüber and Niemöller survived, not all did: Dietrich Bonhoeffer was sent initially to Tegel Prison, then to Buchenwald concentration camp, and finally to Flossenbürg concentration camp, where he was hanged. This left Christians who did not agree with the Nazis without leadership for much of the era.

Early life

Blanche Lindo was born on 9 December 1912 in San José, Costa Rica, the daughter of Percival Henriques "Percy" Lindo and Hilda Violet Lindo.[4][5][6][7]

She was a product of cousin marriage, both her mother and father
descendants of the Lindo family, a Sephardi Jewish family originally
from Spain who suffered persecution for their religion and so, became
New Christians. Ultimately, Blackwell's ancestor, Alexandre Lindo, would
go onto settle in Kingston, Jamaica in the 18th century and he and his
descendants would make their fortune there as merchants, financiers and
planters. .

in the manufacture of fertilizer. As a teenager in Jamaica, Cecil

Alexandre Lindo was the son of Abraham Lindo (Amsterdam, 1711 – London, 1808) and his wife Marianne (died in London, 1779). He was born in 1742, probably in Paris or Bordeaux, France. He married for the first time in 1769 and had 7 children with his wife Hannah. After her death he married again in 1782. His second wife was Esther Salome, with whom he had 16 more children. Hannah Lindo was the first child in this marriage.

Alexandre started his successful career as a merchant in Jamaica
purchasing and distributing the whole cargo of boats. Soon he began a
credit business with the local merchants. As his wealth increased he
bought large land properties. He managed or alternatively rented to
great profit a coffee plantation. Furthermore, he invested in real
estate buying strategic areas in Kingston. He had his own well equipped
pier which was called “Lindo’s wharf”. He made a business buying and
reselling the goods of captured boats in the Caribbean. In 1775 he
entered the lucrative slave trade. By 1793 Lindo & Lake was the largest
slave factoring company in Jamaica. By 1796 his house on Tower Street
was the largest in Kingston, with 4 two-wheeled and 8 four- wheeled
vehicles, and 30 servants. Besides he owned two transatlantic vessels
and numerous properties..

[Petrus Alphonsi - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Alphonsi)

> Up until the _Dialogi contra Iudaeos_, the Augustinian tradition was
> followed in Christendom which allowed relative tolerance to the Jewish
> people, and for the most part up until this point the attacks on the
> Jewish people were localized and more importantly, not organized.
> There was no literature before Petrus Alfonsi’s _Dialogi_ condemning

This work presented a point of view contrary to previous Christian
philosophy because Christians claimed that the Jews were blindly
practicing the Old Law. Petrus Alfonsi initiated a differing idea that
“the Jews no longer followed the Old Law; they follow a new and
heretical law, that of the Talmud.” Petrus’ belief was that the Jewish
leaders were knowingly and willfully leading their flock astray. He
believed that they purposely lied in order to conceal their sin of
killing Jesus, in spite of the fact that they knew that he was the Son
of God. Petrus Alfonsi also claimed that the Talmud was written to keep
the Jewish people from seeing that Jesus was the Son of God; he called
the Talmud “a fabric of lies” and a “heretical book.” .


The Dialogi contra Iudaeos represented a turning point in not only
polemical strategy, but also the perception of Judaism. In the Dialogi,
Alfonsi argued with himself as his old Jewish self (Moses) and his new
converted Christian self (Peter). What made this particular strategy of
polemics so influential was the ability to control the argument
legitimately without the need of a second party. Since the argument was
between Judaism and Christianity, and Alfonsi was once a Jew and then a
Christian, he was able to argue both sides with accuracy. By arguing
against himself in the Dialogi, he was able to set the parameters of the
argument without any unforeseen issues from a second party. Petrus was
able to make each side say what he wanted; because of this, it was
authoritative, and became a damaging piece to the perception of the
Jews. .
