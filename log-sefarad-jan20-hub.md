Port Cities of Atlantic Iberia, c. 15001900 by Patrick OFlanagan (z-lib.org).pdf

How can this ascendancy be accounted for? For the most part it was a legacy of Pombal’s rigid 
political economy, which, in 1774, reduced the privileges of, and investments in, ports such as 
Aveiro, Caminha, Esposende, Viana do Castelo and Vila do Conde and barred them from engaging 
in certain maritime trading activities. Oporto benefited enormously from this prohibition and a 
contemporary observer noted that the trades of the ports mentioned above were, almost in their 
entirety, transferred to Oporto (Rebelo da Costa, 1954). 
Both Oporto and Lisbon also held exclusive rights regarding the importation of most colonial


...(Mountinho, 1985). Viana then became the location, in 1654, for Portugal’s third English feitoria, 
an acknowledgement of its prime trading role. Most of its resident merchants were involved in 
the exportation of Grand Banks cod. Many boats returning from overseas called to Viana and/or 
Oporto, where they exchanged slaves for wine that was then sold on at English ports. By the end of 
the seventeenth century, the activities of Viana’s English feitoria were progressively transferred to 
Oporto conceding to it an enhanced pivotal role as Portugal’s premier northern Atlantic port.
During the seventeenth century at Oporto, there was a sustained, if
slow, increase in port ...


....Changes that were more substantial became evident in the period after c.1660, as goods from 
England, France, Holland and Hamburg replaced those items that had been traditionally sourced 
from Atlantic Spain. From England came textiles, cod, metal products and paper and these goods 
were largely dispatched from London, Dartmouth, Weymouth and Plymouth. Imports of all kinds 
came from France and Holland chiefly through the ports of Bayonne (wool), Bordeaux (flax) and 
La Rochelle (brai), as well as cereals from many French Atlantic ports. The Brazil trade was weak 
at the time because of political turmoil. Wood for furniture and boat building came from Hamburg 
or Holland. 
A visitor to the port in 1669 recorded that its activities were
relatively modest and noted that ....

António Galvão was the son of Duarte Galvão, chief diplomat and chronicler to king Afonso V of Portugal.[1] 


António Galvão left two manuscripts. One was the treaty of the discoveries printed after his death, in 1563, in Lisbon by his friend Francisco de Sousa Tavares.[4] Based on numerous written sources and documents, the work presented for the first time a synthesis of all the discoveries made by Portuguese and Spanish until 1550. Richard Hakluyt had it translated and published in English in 1601 as "The discoveries of the world - by Antonio Galvano".


...It is alleged that a good part of it was reproduced verbatim within
Damião de Góis's 1566-67 Chronica del rey D. Manuel, but all trace of
the original Galvão manuscript disappeared after Góis's death.[5]...

Early life

Blanche Lindo was born on 9 December 1912 in San José, Costa Rica, the daughter of Percival Henriques "Percy" Lindo and Hilda Violet Lindo.[4][5][6][7]

She was a product of cousin marriage, both her mother and father
descendants of the Lindo family, a Sephardi Jewish family originally
from Spain who suffered persecution for their religion and so, became
New Christians. Ultimately, Blackwell's ancestor, Alexandre Lindo, would
go onto settle in Kingston, Jamaica in the 18th century and he and his
descendants would make their fortune there as merchants, financiers and
planters. .

of Fleming's most memorable female characters; Pussy Galore and
Honeychile Rider.[11][3] Her brother, Roy Lindo, sold land to Fleming
and Coward for their Jamaican houses.[2]...

She became friends with prominent figures and celebrities of the time
including Errol Flynn, whom she met when he was holidaying in
Jamaica.[3] She continued to be involved with her son's life and work,
hosting parties and giving advice.[12] .

...They all had the Jewish penchant for putting their hands and minds to
anything that looked like it would prosper. Abraham (1711–1808) was a
diamond cutter. David (1833–1889) was a chemist in Falmouth (Jamaica)
who invented the Lindo- Sladding process which is still used worldwide
in the manufacture of fertilizer. As a teenager in Jamaica, Cecil
(1870–1950) is said to have owned only a bicycle and was packed off to
Costa Rica by his parents for falling in love with a Gentile. He founded
the great banana empire that became the United Fruit Company, and by his
mid-twenties was exporting five million stems of bananas a year, beside
vast quantities of coffee and sugar. Roy Lindo (1910–1962), after whom I
am named, was a tycoon with financial tentacles in every corner of
Jamaica. He and his family lived at Terra Nova (now a hotel), and owned
great houses all over Jamaica, including magnificent Devon House,
Strawberry Hill (also now a hotel), and Odnil (Lindo backwards) which is
now the famous Bob Marley Museum in Kingston.

Alexandre Lindo was the son of Abraham Lindo (Amsterdam, 1711 – London, 1808) and his wife Marianne (died in London, 1779). He was born in 1742, probably in Paris or Bordeaux, France. He married for the first time in 1769 and had 7 children with his wife Hannah. After her death he married again in 1782. His second wife was Esther Salome, with whom he had 16 more children. Hannah Lindo was the first child in this marriage.

Alexandre started his successful career as a merchant in Jamaica
purchasing and distributing the whole cargo of boats. Soon he began a
credit business with the local merchants. As his wealth increased he
bought large land properties. He managed or alternatively rented to
great profit a coffee plantation. Furthermore, he invested in real
estate buying strategic areas in Kingston. He had his own well equipped
pier which was called “Lindo’s wharf”. He made a business buying and
reselling the goods of captured boats in the Caribbean. In 1775 he
entered the lucrative slave trade. By 1793 Lindo & Lake was the largest
slave factoring company in Jamaica. By 1796 his house on Tower Street
was the largest in Kingston, with 4 two-wheeled and 8 four- wheeled
vehicles, and 30 servants. Besides he owned two transatlantic vessels
and numerous properties..
