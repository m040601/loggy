Sometimes clean removal of pressure sensitive tape can be difficult
without damaging the substrate that it is adhered to. Pulling at a slow
rate and with a low angle of peel helps reduce surface damage. PSA
residue can be softened with certain organic solvents or heat. Extreme
cold (dry ice, freeze spray, etc.) can cause viscoelastic materials to
change to a glass phase; thus it is useful for removing many types of
PSAs. [3] .
