To profile the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese historiographical traditions because (i) of the central role that the writing of history played (and continues to play) in Chinese politics and culture and (ii) to a greater extent than is commonly realized, historians rely on works produced in the old historiographical traditions, even though they may ask different questions and use different conceptual frameworks.

Most of the censored passages (and no attempt was made to show them all)
are in one of four categories: (i) anything that might indicate that top
CCP leaders are less than infallibly correct at all times. For example,
in a discussion of political slogans Wilkinson mentions that during a
meeting with Li Xiannian in 1979, the Vice Premier underlined the
importance of the Four Modernizations but was unable to recall more than
the first three (page 302). The paragraphs recounting this episode have
been erased. Equally unacceptable to the censor were comparisons of
CCP-era practices with rituals and procedures characteristic of imperial
China. For example, in a discussion of flattering imperial honorific
titles (zunhao 尊號) bestowed upon China's emperors during their
lifetimes, the author remarked that “zunhao” (in scare quotes)
reappeared with the personality cult of Mao Zedong at the start of the
Cultural Revolution (his was 20 characters long: 伟大的导师, 伟大的领袖,
伟大的统帅, 伟大的舵手 (Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Commander,
Great Helmsman). The paragraph was scrubbed (page 288); (2) anything
touching border issues even if this meant deleting a passage from a
historical source that contradicts the current CCP line while retaining
a passage from the same source that supports it (page 203). Even the
author's correct observation that the History of the Ming (1745), the
official history of the dynasty, places Taiwan in the section reserved
for foreign countries was deleted (page 953); (3) anything showing
Chinese people making fun of propaganda slogans (page 302); (4) any
statistical estimate that differs from official statistics on sensitive
issues was simply suppressed. For example, the number of people who died
of starvation during the Great Chinese Famine (page 542).[4]

The Book of Swindles - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Swindles)
----

> _**The Book of Swindles**_ (_Piàn jīng_ 騙經), also known by its longer title, _A New Book for Foiling Swindlers, Based on Worldly Experience_ (_Jiānghú lìlǎn dùpiàn xīnshū_ 江湖歷覽杜騙新書), is said to be the first Chinese story collection about fraud.\[1\] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Swindles#cite_note-1) The collection contains eighty-four short stories about swindling, fraud, and deception. Written and compiled by Zhang Yingyu, it was published in Fujian province in or around 1617, and most of its stories are set during the latter part of the Ming dynasty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty").




As a whole, the collection presents a panoramic survey of deceptive practices in contemporary Ming society by a critic keenly interested in the dangers faced by common people, especially traveling merchants. Many stories feature a merchant encountering a swindler while traveling to sell goods in another province or while returning home from a business trip with earnings in hand. Ostensibly written as a manual for self-protection against swindlers, it also offers an expert guide to the art of deception.


During the late Ming, China underwent a flourishing of domestic and international commerce that created overnight fortunes. The Book of Swindles captures a sense of the paranoia that resulted from the new risks and social change brought by this flow of money. Most of the stories concern stratagems for siphoning off some of the wealth circulating through the roads, canals, and market alleyways of the prosperous southern regions of the empire.[5]



The setting of the book, as mentioned in its longer title, is the imaginary realm of the jianghu (Rivers and Lakes), where kin are scarce and strangers might turn out to be predators. The jianghu is a place of refuge for political exiles, outlaws, martial artists, socially marginal figures, and people hiding from the law. It is also a realm of commerce plied by merchants, petty entrepreneurs, civil service examinations candidates, officials heading to and from their posts, monks, medicine men, soothsayers, entertainers, mendicants, and swindlers. The overarching maxim of the jianghu is that people are often not what they seem, which is integral to the swindle story.[3]



Zhang Yingyu (张应俞), style name Kui Zhong (夔衷),[7] is an obscure figure. The Book of Swindles is the only known work to appear under his name, and no record of him survives in any biographical source. Zhang lived during the Wanli period (1563–1620) of the Ming dynasty. A note on the title page of one Ming dynasty copy claims that he was from Zhejiang province, while a 1617 preface says that he was from Fujian.[3]


The Book of Swindles incorporates elements from a variety of other Chinese genres, especially court case fiction, in which a capable magistrate solves a crime.[8] Stories involving sorcerers, Buddhist monks, and Daoist priests, who engage in alchemy or dream spirit possession, include motifs from supernatural tales. Other stories, featuring suspense, surprise and revelation, resemble jokes in structure. A minority include apocryphal anecdotes about historical figures. Zhang draws on stock scenarios and character types from vernacular fiction and drama, such as the charlatan Daoist, the duplicitous broker, and the foolish scion of a rich family.[9] Dropped bags, ingenious thievery, and imposture also appear in fiction by contemporaries such as Feng Menglong (1574–1645), Ling Mengchu (1580–1644), and Li Yu (1610–80). Venal monks and eunuchs, lying procuresses and go-betweens appear in a wide array of vernacular literature, including contemporary novels such as The Water Margin (Shui hu zhuan, first extant imprint 1589) and Plum in the Golden Vase (Jin ping mei, first extant imprint 1610).[3] Collections of swindle stories can also be found in contemporary China.[10]

The Book of Swindles also appeared around the same time as the seventeenth-century heyday of the Spanish picaresque novel, which often features rogues, tricksters, delusive figures, and swindlers roaming the lands in search of opportunity or fortune. Contemporaneous Spanish works include El Buscon (The Swindler) and Don Quixote. The theme, structure, and spirit of Zhang Yingyu's work also resemble that of swindle story collections from Europe and America, such as Richard King's The New Cheats of London Exposed (ca. 1790) and James Perry Johnston's How to Hustle (1905). Elaborate scams detailed in the "Corruption in Education" section of The Book of Swindles also anticipate "big cons" of early twentieth-century con men such as "The Big Store," as described by sociolinguist David Maurer in The Big Con.
