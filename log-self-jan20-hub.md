Stephenson relays his experience with the Debian bug tracking system
(#6518). He then contrasts it with Microsoft's approach. Debian
developers responded from around the world within a day. He was
completely frustrated with his initial attempt to achieve the same
response from Microsoft, but he concedes that his subsequent experience
was satisfactory. The difference he notes is that Debian developers are
personally accessible and transparently own up to defects in their OS
distribution, while Microsoft pretends errors don't exist. .

> t seems to me that the root problem is that students are never told, in serious terms, that getting the right answers is important. The way we signal importance is with grades. Students who have received passing grades for incorrect work through many years of school can hardly be expected to show attention to detail in university.

... We had this unspoken of law back in school where you better off write any answer than leaving the question empty. This is quite possibly drives some of these answers (at least here in my case)

I had a few teachers that gave negative points for wrong answers to prevent guesswork. The idea being that empty answers were feedback to them on what they might not have taught well.

I love this. Perhaps answers could be a tuple of confidence and the answer. Guessing is important, being unsure of your answer is also important.

ayn rand the trader principle
----

 But Rand's basic guideline for human relationships was what she called
 the trader principle: deal with others by trading value for value, by
 mutual consent to mutual advantage, never seeking nor granting the
 unearned, never sacrificing yourself to others nor others to yourself.
 In other words, seek only win-win relationships..

The maxim to "create more value than you capture" is a corollary. If you try to capture more than you create, you're seeking the unearned. When you create more than you capture, you're making sure that those you trade with are getting something out of the deal, too.
