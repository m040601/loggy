Stephenson relays his experience with the Debian bug tracking system
(#6518). He then contrasts it with Microsoft's approach. Debian
developers responded from around the world within a day. He was
completely frustrated with his initial attempt to achieve the same
response from Microsoft, but he concedes that his subsequent experience
was satisfactory. The difference he notes is that Debian developers are
personally accessible and transparently own up to defects in their OS
distribution, while Microsoft pretends errors don't exist. .
